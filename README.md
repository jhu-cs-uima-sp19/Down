Team I - Down

This is the repository for UIMA 601.290 in Spring 2019. 

The purpose of this repository is to create and implement the Down App as
defined in the first part of the semester.

We have finished all praduct backlog requirements for sprint 2.
We have completed all Sprint 1, Sprint 2, and stretch goal
requirements, namely: notifications of different types, 
notification settings, friend profile, group page, making groups,
sending downs to groups, and additional "above-and-beyond" features
such as a tutorial for first-time users and a credit page.

All down creation and feed works as desired, and has been rigorously
error checked. 

Future prospects:
1. Fix small issues such as string plurality ("1 downs", or "1 people")
2. Database security - privitizing the database to prevent hacks
3. Testing on earliest possible devices and different screen sizes / 
	modifications to work on older devices.
4. Facebook sign-in integration so it is easier to find friends
5. Submitting to Google Play Store
6. Creating iOS version


These shouldn't take too long (other than 7), and are currently underway.

----Testing login information for grader----
username: requests@password1234.com
password: password1234

username: mrpop@password1234.com
password: password1234

(Notice) Due to the fact that the downs are scheduled to reset every 24 hours,
the downs present on each of these accounts at the time of submitting
may not be the downs that are present at the time of grading.
Feel free to create more downs, though!

Additionally, I attached notifications.js to the top level of the zip.
This file contains all of the javascript code that makes the notifications
work. The code is presently hosted in Firebase, so I attached it separately
for reference.

Thank you very much, and hope you have a great Summer!
